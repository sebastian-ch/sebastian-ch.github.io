Welcome to my digital garden! This is a place where I cultivate ideas, connect thoughts, and learn in public.

## What is a Digital Garden?

A digital garden is different from a traditional blog. Instead of polished, finished posts ordered by date, it's a collection of interconnected notes at various stages of development.

Notes can be:
- **Seedlings**: New ideas, just planted
- **Budding**: Developing thoughts, getting more refined
- **Evergreen**: Well-developed, continually updated content

## How to Navigate

You can explore by:
1. Clicking on [[wiki-style links]] to jump between connected notes
2. Using the tag filters on the garden page
3. Exploring the knowledge graph to see how ideas connect

## Learn More
